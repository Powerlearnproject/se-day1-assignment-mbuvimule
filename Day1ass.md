Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-It is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software to solve real world problems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
--Development of high level programming languages such as COBOL and Fortan
-Shift to Object Oriented Programming
-Shift to Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-planning, designing, testing, deployment and maintenance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall is rigid, changes are difficult to implement whereas Agile is flesible and adaptable to changes. 
-Waterfall is linear and sequential whereas Agile is iterative and incremental
-Waterfall requires heavy planning beforehand whereas Agile requires continuous, reprioritization and progressive planning
-In Waterfall testing is done after development is complete whereas in Agile testing is done progressively i.e. continuous testing
-In Waterfall there is limited customer involvement until final product is delivered whereas in Agile there is continuous customer feedback and involvement
-In Waterfall there is high rist due to late testing whereas in Agile risk levels are low due to early issue detection
-In Waterfall there is comprehensive documentation upfront whreeas in Agile there is light weight documentation focusing on working software
-In Waterfall delivery is done on a complete product whereas in Agile small usable increaments are delivered.
*Waterfall is majorly used in infrastructural projects where there is very little or no changes from the original plan whereas Agile is best for dynamic and changing projects such as developing a new digital product, a new mobile app etc. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-writing clean, efficient and scalable code, developing software based on desgin specifications and requirements, debugging and troubleshooting issues, ensures team collboration, keeping up with best practices, technology and security protocols. 
Quality Assurance Engineer-creating and executing test cases, identifying bugs and documenting issues and working with developers to fix them, performing functional performance and security testing, ensuring compliance with quality standards and user specifications, maintaining test documents and automation scripts
Project Manager-defining project scope, objectives and timelines, assigning tasks and maintaining team workload, tracking progress and ensuring deadlines are met, facilitating communication between stakeholders and technical teams, managing budget risks and resources

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated Development Environments (IDEs)-Streamlines software development process by providing essential tools within a single interface improving efficiency and productivity. Its benefits include; code editing and autocompletion, debugging tools, project management, intergration with VSC and testing tools. e.g. VS Code, Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, PyCharm
Version Control Systems (VCS)-Enables devlopers to track changes, collaborate efficiently and maintain project integrity by keeping a hitory of modifications. Its benefits are; collboration and team work, code history and recovery, branching and merging, backup and security e.g. Git, (GitHub,GitLab,Bitbucket), Apache SubVersion (ASN)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-(Challenge) Keeping up with rapidly changing technologies (Solution) follow industry blogs, podcasts and newsletters, taking online courses and certifications, engaging in open source projects and hackathons to learn new projects. 
-(Challenge) Debugging complex issues (Solution) Use debugging tools and logging frameworks, breakdown the problem systematically using print statements or step through debugging, collaborate with team members and use pair programming for fresh perspectives
-(Challenge) Managing technical debt (Solution) Refactor code regularly and enforce coding standards, use automated testing to catch regressions early, allocate time for each debt in sprint planning
-(Challenge) Working in large distributed teams (Solution) Use project management tools (Jira, Trello) and version control (Git), schedule regular stand up meetings and use asynchronous communication (slack, teams), document codes and processes clearly to reduce misunderstandings
-(Challenge) Meeting tight deadlines (Solution) Use agile methodologies to breakdown work into manageable tasks, prioritize tasks using frameworks like MosCow (Must-have,Should-have, Could-have, Wont-have), avoid overcommiting i.e. provide realistic deadlines
-Challenge) Security and data privacy risks (Solution) Follow secure coding practices and impliment encryption where needed, conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, stay updated on security vulnerabilities

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing-tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation and ensures each unit of code works correctly. e.g. PyTest-Python. Importance: Catches bugs early in developement, improves code reliability and maintainability. 
Intergration testing-Tests interaction between different modules and components of a system and ensures intergrated components work together as expected. E.g JUnit and Spring in Java. Importance: identifies interface issues between modules, ensures data flows correctly between components
System testing-Tests the entire system as a whole to validate its compliance with requirements and ensures software works correctly in its intended environment. Importance: detects systems wide defects, confirms the software meets functional and performance requirements
Acceptance testing-Validates whether the software meets business or user requirements before release. Types: UAT AND BAT. Importance: confirms that the product is ready for deployment, ensures that the product meets customer expectations. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-It is the process of cratfing and optimizing inputs to guide AI models such LLMs in generating accurate, relevant and useful responses.
Importance
-Enhances response accuracy
-Optimizes AI performance
-Increases efficiency and productivity
-Customizes AI for specific use cases
-Improves AI driven decision making

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
'Write about climate change'
Issues with this prompt.
1. Too broad
2. Lacks focus-Unclear whether the response should be scientic, economic, environmental, political etc
3. Could lead to unstructured or generic response
Improved Prompt
'Explain the main causes of climate change and their impact on global weather patterns in the last decade'
Why this prompt is more effective?
1. Clearer scope-focuses on causes and weather patterns narrowing to a clearer scope
2. Specific timeframe-Has focus on the last decade
3. Concise and structured-Guides AI to provide a relevant and well organized response
